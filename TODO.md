== Needed ==
* javascript timer to reload/transition dashboard page when game begins or ends (maybe a partial or template?)

== Optional ==
* resize photos to fit a certain screen size, use that in slideshow
** or maybe just set width and height in the slideshow html?
* add denormalized team_id to photos? (and update a user's photos when a user gets a new team?)
* enforce maximum team size?
* enforce starts-at, don't allow showing missions beforehand
* enforce ends-at, show time remaining
* developer auth method for development
* bonus points by admin
** display bonuses in slideshow

==Future==
* Allow any admin to create and manage their own games
** when dealing with most things, admin is on game level rather than overall; can't muck with someone else's game
** set starting location
** email login info settable by game
* auto svg/pdf of printable mission list
* Allow downloading of all photos as zipfile
* drag-and-drop reordering mission priorities
* allow buying tickets to a game via Stripe
* teams have leaders?
** rename your team
** invite others via email to join the game (and your team)
* write to Google spreadsheet? read from Google spreadsheet? https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby
* "test mission" for beginning of game?
